## Tests

This project is mostly about the tests. `todo.test.js` contains integration tests for the app. They run in the browserâ€”open `index.html` and view the console to see test results.

Features were developed TDD style: failing test written first, then a feature implemented to make the test pass, then refactoring if necessary. You can see how this worked in the commit history.
